// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  NC ML — Multi-Agent Swarm System
//
//  Multiple reasoning agents try different approaches in
//  parallel, and the swarm selects the best result.
//
//  Inspired by:
//    - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
//    - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
//    - Ensemble methods
//
//  Features:
//    - Agent creation with different strategies
//    - Parallel candidate generation
//    - Swarm scoring + selection
//    - Pheromone trails (ACO-style reinforcement)
//    - Agent specialization
//    - Consensus voting
//    - Swarm memory (shared knowledge)
//
//  Usage:
//    nc nc-ai-sdk/sdk/ml/swarm.nc
